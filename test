The things I think we need assistance with

1)       Valid certificates
for OpenShift – to get WebHooks working

2)       How will we be
managing certificates for our dynamic environments

3)       Mark is still having
issues with HTTP/2

4)       Still don’t have
firewall rules to connect to Apple

5)       How are we going to
do local development? CDK?

6)       How will we interact
with MQ?  Will there be a centralized MQ infrastructure, Kafka, some
combination, something else?

7)       Get a Splunk
Forwarder template into our catalog

8)       Get the EFK template
into our catalog (I’ve attached instructions from Arseni on EFK)

9)       Monitoring

 

 

The list of things I want to learn how to do in OpenShift
(not comprehensive)

 

1)       Get existing ant
builds working in an ephemeral Jenkins (the retail repository share to be
available )

2)       Get SSL configured to
work the “right” way

3)       Get an application
that uses MQ working

4)       Use the OpenShift EFK
stack (requires some storage and I think a new template)

5)       Configure
Jenkins/OpenShift/GitHub web hooks

6)       Get an application
that uses a database working

7)       Figure out how we
want to manage our configuration.
